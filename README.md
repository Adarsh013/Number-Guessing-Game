# Number-Guessing-Game
A fun number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player has 10 attempts to guess a randomly generated number. After each guess, the game records the previous guesses, shows the number of guesses remaining, and provides feedback on whether the entered number is too low or too high.
